- [✅] Clear legal notices on FAA products
- [⚠️] FPV simulator authorization needed

- [❌] Fulfillment automation not yet set up
- [❌] Terms of Service needed
- [❌] Privacy Policy needed
- [❌] Refund Policy needed

## BOTTOM LINE

**Your shop is legally compliant for the FAA study materials** (which are your main products). However, **it's not currently functional as a real e-commerce store** - it's more of an "order request form" that sends you emails.

**To make it a REAL shop, you need:**
1. Remove or authorize the FPV simulator product
2. Add payment processing (Stripe/PayPal)
3. Set up actual fulfillment for each product type
4. Add legal policies (Terms, Privacy, Refunds)
5. Consider business insurance

**Current State:** Legal but manual
**Needed State:** Legal AND automated
